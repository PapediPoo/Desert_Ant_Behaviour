# Desert Ant Behaviour

## Overview

This code is part of our project in Agent Based Modelling and Social Simulations. Our paper with detailed explanations can be found in Paper.pdf.

We simulated the food-gathering behaviour of desert ants. Our environment is represented by a two-dimensional plane and contains the nest, (possibly) multiple food-sources and landmarks which are used by the ants for orientation. An ant performs the following actions:

    - The ant starts at the nest (with coordinates (0, 0)) and performs a biased random walk (biased toward the current direction vector) until it stumbles upon food. On its way, it saves for each dicovered landmark the directional vector to the previous landmark (or to the nest for the first landmark). Once the ant has found food, it uses these vectors to walk back to the nest.
    - Because the walking-back-to-the-nest is also a biased random walk (though with a stronger bias towards the visited landmarks than in food-search behaviour), a probability exists that the ants loses its track. It then switches back to search behaviour until it finds another known landmark.
    - Once the ant found back to the nest, its journey has ended.

## Adjustable Parameters

The environment can be controlled by the following parameters (found in Environment/EnvironmentParameters.py):

    - the number of nests,
    - the number of landmarks,
    - the number of food sources,
    - the width and the height of the playground and
    - the action range which describes the minimal distances for which an ant has "found" the nest or a food source.

The simulation itself can be controlled by the following parameters (found in Simulation/SimulationParameters.py):

    - the move-speed which describes the distance traveled during a timestep,
    - the standard deviation of the move angle in food-search behaviour,
    - the standard deviation of the move angle in nest-search behaviour,
    - the vision range which describes the minimal distance for which an ant "sees" a landmark and
    - the number of ants.

There are two ways to run a simulation:

## Graphical Interface

With the graphical interface, one can play with the various simulation parameters and visualize the paths taken by the ants. To start the graphical interface, one can use the following command:

    python -m UI.SimulationWindow

## Batch Simulation

To gather statistics of the typical behaviour with respect to different parameters, a batch simulation can be performed by executing 

    python -m Statistics.MeasureStepCount

In MeasureStepCount.py, mutiple simulations are executed simultaniously on multiple cores. The simulations on each process are parameterized by the thread index and can thus simulate differents parameters. One has to consider that simulating even one degree of freedom takes quite some time depending on the processor and memory.

The graphs produced by the batch simulations we perfomed can be found in the folder "Desert Ant Behaviour Graphics".

## Notes Regarding Reproducability

The code is written for Python 3.7. We used the following libraries:

    - numpy
    - matplotlib

They can be installed using pip with

    pip install numpy matplotlib

Since we use sibling package imports, you have to use the -m argument when executing a script from commandline:

    python -m UI.SimulationWindow
