- Simulated 100 ants per step.
- Simulated on 600x600 environment
- The setup of the environment can be found as an .svg file
- If another environment was used, it will be stated.

Observations
- Sometimes strong deviations between single data points. This is probably due to the strongly random nature of the simulation.
- Thermal throttling might influence the precentage of ants that find back to the nest. This is because the simulation has a timer
based cutoff which favours faster CPUs. But if an ant really gets lost it usually is easy to tell, since the lost ant takes
 orders of magnitude longer to find the nest than an ant that isn't lost.
- Simulating "only" 100 Ants per iteration might seem like a small number. But since each ant can take up to 5 seconds, each core
handles 25 ants and there are about 30 iterations per simulation, a single simulation already takes around 45-70 minutes.
