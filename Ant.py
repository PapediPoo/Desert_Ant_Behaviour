	* Describes a single Ant (State&Behaviour).
	* An ant can either be searching, going back to the nest, or be on its way to the food (if its found)
	* Initially the ant will be randomly searching the food. Once food is found, it remembers which landmarks
	* it has seen in the past and how to get from each previous landmark to the next. That way the and will be
	* able to trace back the path it has taken from its nest to the food. This means that the ant associates
	* a single directional vector with each landmark which denotes the relative position of the next landmark
	* on the path from the nest to the food. If it sees multiple landmarks, it will take the sum of the
	* directional vectors.
